# RDA_python
Python codes written to finish manuscript on the Rainband Detection Algorithm.

List of completed sub-projects:
-RDA_bars_with_whiskers.ipynb: Show the mean and std dev of band frequency and intensity during different time periods, and also overlays the p-value of significance of changes between time periods (51-79 v 80-07 and 80-93 v 94-07). Replaces table from thesis. Produces figure RDA_bar_final.pdf

-RDA_hov_frequency_intensity_plots.ipynb: Creates Hovmoller plots of climatological rainband frequency, intensity and net rainfall produced, and also figures showing decadal changes. Produces figures hov_freq_int_climo.pdf, hov_freq_int_8007_5179.pdf and hov_freq_int_9407_8093.pdf.
